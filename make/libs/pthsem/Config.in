		GNU pth is a user mode multi threading library.
		
		pthsem is a fork, with support for semaphores added. It can be 
		installed parallel to a normal pth and provides a compatibilty 
		layer to compile GNU pth programs with pthsem. The header file 
		is called pthsem.h, the configuration programm pthsem-config and 
		the autoconf macro AC_CHECK_PTHSEM. If references to one of these 
		names are changed, pthsem can be used as an replacement of GNU pth.
